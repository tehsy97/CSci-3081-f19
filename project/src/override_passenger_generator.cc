 *  GeneratePassengers uses the route's passenger generation probabilities per stop to determine how many passengers to create.
 *  Each probability is a double, i.e., .90 for a 90% probability of a passenger arriving at a stop for this bus route.
 *  While the probability is > .0001 (.01%), we attempt to generate passengers. Each time, we multiply the probability by itself, reduing the likelihood of additional passengers each time.
 *  This controls for multiple passengers arriving at a given time.
 *  Once the probability drops below .0001, we end our generation cycle for the stop.
